Created a cool looking Tic Tac Toe Module. Hope you enjoy :)

Things I learned
-> I see lots of ways I can improve my code my caching the DOM and also by using init() more efficiently through call backs
-> I can also make my code better by having each function only do one thing.
-> I'm learning that caching the DOM and using object states are one of the best ways to make a program work.

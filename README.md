Created a cool looking Tic Tac Toe Module. Hope you enjoy :)

Things I learned
-> I see lots of ways I can improve my code my caching the DOM and also by using init() more efficiently through call backs
-> I can also make my code better by having each function only do one thing.
-> I'm learning that caching the DOM and using object states are one of the best ways to make a program work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I organized a couple of functions for better readability. I'm thinking about placing certain functions into their own modules.
I saw something where you place functions like "cashdom" inside of an object literal "init" and then execute those functions.
To do that, I may have to check to see if certain ID's exist or hardcode the IDs into my HTML. These are some things that I
could do but I feel that I've learned a lot from this project and I'm ready to learn more.

I also feel really good about my pattern function at the bottom. I really impressed myself with how I was able to shove
Tic Tac Toe patterns into a function and spit out real data.
